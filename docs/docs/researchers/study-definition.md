# JSON files for Study Definition

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is at the sweet spot between human-readable and machine-readable. The information is saved as key-value pairs in a file with the `.json` extension.

Tellmi uses JSON-Files to:
- define items and measures
- defining the study procedure
- configuring meta-information about the study (e.g. study name, contact information, language(s) etc.)
